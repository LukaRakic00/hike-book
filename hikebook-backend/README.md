## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected endpoints:

1. **Sign up** or **Sign in** using the auth endpoints
2. Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`
3. The token will be automatically validated and the user ID extracted

## Database Schema

The application uses your existing PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- **destination**: Geographic locations
- **activity**: Available activities (hiking, biking, etc.)
- **trail**: Hiking trails with details
- **user**: User accounts
- **favorite_trails**: User's favorite trails (many-to-many)
- **trail_activity**: Trail-activity relationships (many-to-many)
- **map**: Trail maps
- **reservation**: User reservations
- **review**: User reviews
- **conditions**: Trail conditions
- **photo**: Trail photos
- **comment**: Trail comments

## Setup and Running

1. **Database Setup:**
   - The application is configured to work with your existing PostgreSQL database
   - Update `application.properties` with your database credentials if needed
   - The application will validate the existing schema

2. **Cloudinary Setup:**
   - Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
   - Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from the dashboard
   - Set environment variables or update `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     cloudinary.cloud-name=your-cloud-name
     cloudinary.api-key=your-api-key
     cloudinary.api-secret=your-api-secret
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **API Testing:**
   - The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
   - Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints
   - Your existing data will be available through the API endpoints

## Error Handling

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

Common error messages:
- "Authorization header is required" - Missing JWT token
- "Invalid token format" - Malformed JWT token
- "Invalid or expired token" - Invalid JWT token
- "Trail not found" - Trail doesn't exist
- "User not found" - User doesn't exist
- "Trail is already in favorites" - Duplicate favorite
- "Trail is not in favorites" - Trying to remove non-existent favorite
